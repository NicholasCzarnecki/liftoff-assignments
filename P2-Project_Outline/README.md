# Project Outline

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I would like to create a logistics application with a focus on the exporting side. This application would create a user profile for each user, allow them to get a quote, create a shipment, and track the shipment. The rates would be based off of miles, type of delivery (next day, standard, etc..), haz/non-haz, and weight.

### Features

User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Create Quote and turn into Shipment: Users will be able to create a quote and turn the quote into an actual shipment if they choose to do so.
Create a shipment: Users will be able to create a shipment without quoting first.
Search: Users will be able to search through quotes or shipments.

### Technologies

This project could be built using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf. I would be open to using other technologies as well.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll need an API to get the distance between 2 area codes so that I can get rates based off of miles. I'm not sure if there is an existing API that would make getting rates easier so I would have to look into that. I also don't know what to do about the tracking part because nothing is really moving in reality. Could that be simulated in a way?
